# Poke-Out

Hello, Pokémon Trainers!

This is a Pokémon version of Breakout Games. As an enthusiastic PokémonGo fan, I made this game to catch rare Pokémons.
I have studied and applied iOS built-in framework SpriteKit, which is a 2D game engine with support for physics engines and effects.

I am also a 26-level PokémonGo trainer :).
